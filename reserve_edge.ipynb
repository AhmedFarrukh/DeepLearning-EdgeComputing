On CHI@Edge, we can use any image that is built for the ARM64 architecture - e.g. anything on [this list](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image&architecture=arm64&q=). In this example, we’re going to run a machine learning application written in Python, so we will use the `python:3.9-slim` image as a starting point for our container. This is a lightweight installation of the Debian Linux operating system with Python pre-installed.\n",
