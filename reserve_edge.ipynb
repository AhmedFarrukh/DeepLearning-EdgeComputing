On CHI@Edge, we can use any image that is built for the ARM64 architecture - e.g. anything on [this list](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image&architecture=arm64&q=). In this example, we’re going to run a machine learning application written in Python, so we will use the `python:3.9-slim` image as a starting point for our container. This is a lightweight installation of the Debian Linux operating system with Python pre-installed.\n",

    "-   `exposed_ports`: if we run any applications inside the container that need to accept incoming requests from a network, we will need to export a “port” number for those incoming requests. Any requests to that port number will be forwarded to this container.\n",
    "-   `command`: if we want to execute a specific command immediately on starting the container, we can specify that as well.\n",
